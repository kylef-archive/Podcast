We get started with the first episode by going over what’s happened in [2014](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Stats-2014/).

## Year in Review

### Web

First of all, we run down what’s changed in the CocoaPods web properties. Including the [introduction of Trunk](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Trunk), our [search engine](http://blog.cocoapods.org/search-engine), and the brand new [metrics API](http://blog.cocoapods.org/metrics-api) where going over the [metrics for QueryKit](http://metrics.cocoapods.org/api/v1/pods/QueryKit). We then cover our new [status page](http://status.cocoapods.org/) and then go over Orta’s [redesign of CocoaDocs](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaDocs2-Launch) and talk about what’s upcoming for Swift documentation with [Jazzy](http://github.com/realm/jazzy).

### Events

There has been an outstanding amount of events hosted by the CocoaPods team over the year. Starting with [The CocoaPodsAlt State of the Union](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-WWDC-Party), our own WWDC party. In the same week, we also hosted a [Pod Roulette Hackathon (San Francisco)](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Hackathon-Summary) and [CocoaPods AltLabs](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-AltLabs/). We then go over one of our favourite events, the [Bug Bash](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-Bug-Bash) where Samuel first took the dive into the CocoaPods code-base.

Orta has had a busy year, he hosted a [Cocoa Komittee (New York)](http://blog.cocoapods.org/The-Kommittee-NYC/) and then various CocoaKucha’s over the world. The first one in [London](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Cocoa-Kucha-2/), then shortly after another in [Berlin](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Cocoa-Kucha-3-Berlin/). He then hosted one of our favourites in [San Francisco](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Cocoa-Kucha-4) where [Delisa](https://twitter.com/kattrali) talked about [Bad Cocoa](https://speakerdeck.com/kattrali/bad-cocoa)

### CocoaPods

2014 has been a huge step for the tool itself, we’ve made a huge strive towards version 1.0. We talk about [CocoaPods plugins](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.28/) and then one of the biggest features of the year [per build configuration Pods in CocoaPods 0.34](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.34/). Both [SoundCloud](http://blog.cocoapods.org/SoundCloud) and [Stripe](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Stripe-Open-Source-Retreat) have sponsored work on CocoaPods this year. Stripe sponsored Samuel to work on the new [dependency resolution algorithm Molinillo, in CocoaPods 0.35](http://blog.cocoapods.org/CocoaPods-0.35/)

## The Changelog

A lot has changed in [CocoaPods 0.36 beta.1](https://github.com/CocoaPods/CocoaPods/blob/0.36.0.beta.1/CHANGELOG.md), it shipped with the long-awaited Swift support which make’s use of Xcode frameworks. If you’re a Pod author, we urge you to check out the [Pod Authors Guide to CocoaPods Frameworks](http://blog.cocoapods.org/Pod-Authors-Guide-to-CocoaPods-Frameworks) to read about possible breaking changes.

## Favourite Pods

This week, we go over some of the pods that we've been working on this year.

Kyle’s been busy pushing Swift Pod’s from back before CocoaPods could handle Swift. He talks about some of his favourites:

- [URITemplate](https://github.com/kylef/URITemplate.swift)
- [Stencil](https://github.com/kylef/Stencil)
- [QueryKit](http://querykit.org/)
- [PathKit](https://github.com/kylef/PathKit)

Samuel talks about [RestKit](http://restkit.org/), the Pod that first exposed CocoaPods to him and started his journey into open source.
